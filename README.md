## Introduction

> **A strongly-typed and statically-compiled high-performance Pythonic language!**

Seq is a programming language for computational genomics and bioinformatics. With a Python-compatible syntax and a host of domain-specific features and optimizations, Seq makes writing high-performance genomics software as easy as writing Python code, and achieves performance comparable to (and in many cases better than) C/C++.

**Think of Seq as a strongly-typed and statically-compiled Python: all the bells and whistles of Python, boosted with strong type system, without any performance overhead.**

Seq is able to outperform Python code by up to 160x. Seq can further beat equivalent C/C++ code by up to 2x without any manual interventions, and also natively supports parallelism out of the box. Implementation details and benchmarks are discussed [in our paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3360551).

Learn more by following the [tutorial](https://docs.seq-lang.org/tutorial.html) or from the [cookbook](https://docs.seq-lang.org/cookbook.html).

## Example

Seq is a Python-compatible language, and the vast majority of Python programs should work without any modifications:

```python
def check_prime(n):
    if n > 1:
        for i in range(2, n):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    else:
        return False

n = 1009
print n, 'is', 'a' if check_prime(n) else 'not a', 'prime'
```

Here is an example that showcases Seq's bioinformatics features: a seeding application in Seq using a hypothetical genome index, like what is typically found in seed-and-extend alignment algorithms:

```python
from sys import argv
from genomeindex import *
type K = Kmer[20]

# index and process 20-mers
@prefetch
def process(kmer: K,
            index: GenomeIndex[K]):
    hits_fwd = index[kmer]
    hits_rev = index[~kmer]
    ...

# index over 20-mers
index = GenomeIndex[K](argv[1])

# stride for k-merization
stride = 10

# sequence-processing pipeline
(FASTQ(argv[2])
  |> seqs
  |> kmers[K](stride)
  |> process(index))
```

A few notable aspects of this code:

- Seq provides native k-mer types, e.g. a 20-mer is represented by `Kmer[20]` as above.
- k-mers can be reverse-complemented with `~`.
- Seq provides easy iteration over common formats like FASTQ (`FASTQ` above).
- Complex pipelines are easily expressible in Seq (via the `|>` syntax).
- Seq can perform pipeline transformations to make genomic index lookups faster via `@prefetch`.

For a concrete example of `genomeindex`, check out our [re-implementation of SNAP's index](test/snap).

## Install

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux and macOS on x86_64 are available alongside [each release](https://github.com/seq-lang/seq/releases). We also have a script for downloading and installing pre-built versions:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -O - https://seq-lang.org/install.sh)"
```

### Build from source
